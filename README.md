# Zeal-8-bit-computer-asm-examples
A collection of Z80 Assembly language examples and projects created for self-study and experimentation on the Zeal 8-bit Computer.

**program1.asm**

This program demonstrates basic arithmetic and output functionality on the Zeal 8-bit Computer. It performs the following steps:

  1. Calculates the sum of two predefined operands (operand1 = 2 and operand2 = 3).

  2. Converts the result into its ASCII representation.

  3. Appends a newline character to the result.

  4. Outputs the result using a syscall and then exits.

This example is designed to run on the Zeal 8-bit Computer and can be compiled using the Zealasm compiler with the following command:

`exec zealasm.bin program1.asm program1.bin`
